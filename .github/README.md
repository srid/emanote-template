# emanote-template

A template repository to create your own Markdown-based [Emanote](https://github.com/srid/emanote) notebook with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) support, as well as to publish it to GitHub Pages.

See https://emanote.srid.ca/start/resources/emanote-template for details.

## Using this template

Click the "Use this template" green button on Github, and in the resulting repository make the following modifications,

1. Change `index.yaml` to use your site's title (and set the same in `index.md`) and a suitable edit URL.
1. Start adding `.md` notes at repository root (you can use VSCode or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/))

If deploying using GitHub Pages, also:

1. Change `flake.nix` to set the `baseUrl` (if your repository is named differently or you are using a CNAME).

Checkout [examples](https://emanote.srid.ca/examples) and [guide](https://emanote.srid.ca/guide) for next steps.
